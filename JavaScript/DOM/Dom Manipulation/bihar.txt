river son is the one of the longest river in bihar after ganga and from this river sand is extracted for 
construction purpose and we all know that sand is one of the most important thing in construction but in bihar 
we doesn't have any regulatory to maintain the sand extraction and sand mafias are the one who are well connected 
to bihar government and regulate the total sand extraction and due to this no profit is for state ... the profit 
goes to politicians and mafias .. also liquor ban is one of the big reason for bihar's less revenue generation and 
hence bihar is already poor state and after liquor ban is one of the poorest among all .. that's why every youth in
 bihar wants to go out for better earning and change the lifestyle of themselves and their family.
